Completed the requirements from 1 to 3. 
However, was not able to draw grid. Cause it was operating on a per pixel basis (every grid was like a pixel). 
Use arrow keys to play. Space key to drop. 
Rotating counterclockwise is Q and clockwise is E, Up arrow key also rotates clockwise. 

Additional Game Logic: 
1. line clearing, detects if theres a filled line, if so, delete. 
2. auto restart, if the spawning space is already blocked, loses and restarts. 
3. space key for hard drop. Allows player to quickly drop pieces to the bottom.
